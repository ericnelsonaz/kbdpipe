kbdpipe
=======

Program creates a fifo to receive keyboard requests, and generates
uinput events for key down and up for the specified key.

Invocation may include a parameter for the name of the fifo, but
will default to /tmp/kbdpipe.

~# kbdpipe /tmp/kbdpipe

The program needs to run with root privilege in order to create
a uinput device. The umask should be set to zero before creation
or the fifo won't be world writable.

~# umask 0 && kbdpipe /tmp/kbdpipe

It can be accessed from another program (including shell scripts)
by just writing a key code to the fifo.

~$ echo 30 > /tmp/kbdpipe
~$ a

Keys are listed in /usr/include/event-codes.h, and KEY_A == 30.

Note that either decimal or 0xHEX integer formats are supported.
